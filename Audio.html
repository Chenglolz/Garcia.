    <p class="lyrics">[Intro]<br>
        Uh<br>
        <br>
        [Verse]<br>
        How can I tell if I'm in the right relationship?<br>
        Aren't you really supposed to know that shit?<br>
        Feel it in your bones and own that shit? I don't know<br>
        Then I had this interaction I've been thinkin' 'bout for like five weeks<br>
        Wonder if he's thinkin' 'bout it too and smiling<br>
        Wonder if he knows that that's been what's inspirin' me<br>
        Wonder if he's judgin' me like I am right now<br>
        <br>
        [Pre-chorus]<br>
        I don't care<br>
        I'd rather tell the truth (truth)<br>
        Than make it worse for you (you), mm<br>
        <br>
        [Chorus]<br>
        If the sun refused to shine<br>
        Baby, would I still be your lover?<br>
        Would you want me there?<br>
        If the moon went dark tonight<br>
        And if it all ended tomorrow<br>
        Would I be the one on your mind, your mind, your mind?<br>
        And if it all ended tomorrow<br>
        Would you be the one on mine?<br>
