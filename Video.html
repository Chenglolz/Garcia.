    She ain't got no money<br>
Her clothes are kinda funny<br>
Her hair is kinda wild and free<br>
Oh, but love grows where my Rosemary goes<br>
And nobody knows like me<br>
    <br>
She talks kinda lazy<br>
And people say she's crazy<br>
And her life's a mystery<br>
Oh, but love grows where my Rosemary goes<br>
And nobody knows like me<br>
    <br>
There's something about her hand holding mine<br>
It's a feeling that's fine<br>
And I just gotta say, hey!<br>
She's really got a magical spell<br>
And it's working so well<br>
That I can't get away<br>
    <br>
I'm a lucky fella<br>
And I just got to tell her<br>
That I love her endlessly<br>
Because love grows where my Rosemary goes<br>
And nobody knows like me<br>
    <br>
There's something about her hand holding mine<br>
It's a feeling that's fine<br>
And I just gotta say, hey!<br>
She's really got a magical spell<br>
And it's working so well<br>
That I can't get away<br>
    <br>
I'm a lucky fella<br>
And I just got to tell her<br>
That I love her endlessly<br>
Because love grows where my Rosemary goes<br>
And nobody knows like me<br>
    <br>
It keeps growing every place she's been<br>
And nobody knows like me<br>
If you've met her, you'll never forget her<br>
And nobody knows like me<br>
(La-la-la) believe it when you've seen it<br>
Nobody knows like me
